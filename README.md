# Cloud Detector and Weather Station
**Using** 
- TN9 IR Thermometer
- Arduino Micro
- Raspberry Pi
- XBee Pro 500mW radios

This project is a simple weather station and cloud detector to be put at an astronomical observing site and be used to see if its worth going up for a visit.

Still very much in development, I literally started it going this weekend.
